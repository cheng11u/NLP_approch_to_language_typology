# A NLP approach to language typology
# Research project @ M2 TAL - IDMC

The goal of the project is to compare the distribution of some syntactic patterns in annotated treebanks and between languages. In order to do so, we use several tools, such as Grew and grewpy.

We reproduced the experiments described in [Choi et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.ranlp-1.33.pdf). We compared the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) distribution among French corpora, and computed the similarity. We also compared the Adjective-Noun (AN) distribution among different languages.
